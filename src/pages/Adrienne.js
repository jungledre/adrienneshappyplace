        Thank you for taking the time to mosey on over here. I hope that it's
        abundantly clear that I have truly loved putting this site together.
        Please enjoy what you find while exploring what makes me happy and what
        I have to offer the world.

        What I've shared here is a shallow dip into the wealth of experiences
        I've had the pleasure of collecting during my time here on Earth. I can
        only share so much through this medium so I hope you take inspiration
        from something you find here that you can pick up and carry along with
        you along your own journey.
